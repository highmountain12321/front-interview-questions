## Title
100 Days Of Frontend Interview Questions

## Description
This repo will contain 500 frontend interview questions which will have HTML, CSS, Javascript & React questions. I will add not any question in which we have to write code, just theory questions.

I've also added some tables, no need to memorize them, just take a look at them few times and you'll easily be able to answer those concepts if asked in interview.

Source of the questions: Google, ChatGPT, Github repos, etc
